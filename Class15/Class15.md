count data and meta data need to match so we do this extra step to get rid of the unmatching column in countdata

``` r
# Note we need to remove the odd first $length col
countData <- as.matrix(countData[,-1])
#could also use countData[,2:7]
head(countData)

Eliminate the rows that have 0 across all of the columns (No zeros - noz)

``` r
inds<- rowSums(countData != 0)
countData<-countData[inds,]
dim(countData)
```

    ## [1] 15975     6

In order to paste the number of rows in my columns to the text of my knitted document I can embed a little code outside of a code chunking using backticks: We now have 15975 genes remaining in our dataset.

Problem
=======

With the intended next step. Got an error for the program not finding the appropriate variation to call any significant changes. The code was altered as seen below in such a way that it still generated output for me to practice the next steps, but the next steps do no yield exactly the same results as example code. Since no significant fold change was detected, the pathway analysis output is not color-coded by up- and down-regulated genes, for instance.

``` r
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=countData,
                             colData=colData,
                             design=~condition)
```

    ## Warning in DESeqDataSet(se, design = design, ignoreRank): 15969 duplicate
    ## rownames were renamed by adding numbers

``` r
dds <- estimateDispersionsGeneEst(estimateSizeFactors(dds))
dispersions(dds) <- mcols(dds)$dispGeneEst
res <- results(nbinomWaldTest(dds))
